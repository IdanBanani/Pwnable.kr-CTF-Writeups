## 1. Challenge

```
Papa brought me a packed present! let's open it.

This is reversing task. all you need is binary
```

## 2. Solution

As the challenge says it is a reversing task, let's download the binary file and open it in IDA.  

![functions_before_unpark](./functions_before_unpark.png "Fuctions before unpacking")

We can find that there are few functions, and a lot of data are unrecognizable. So it probably has been packed.

Let's use `Shift + F12` to open IDA's string window:  
   
![string_window_in_ida](./string_window_in_ida.png "String window in IDA")  
   
We can find there is a string about UPX, so we can assume that this binary file is probably packed by UPX.

Go to [https://upx.github.io/](https://upx.github.io/ "https://upx.github.io/") and download UPX packer.

Here we work in Windows and unpack the binary file:

```
D:\Tools\upx394w>upx -d flag -o flag.unpacked
                        Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
                          Copyright (C) 1996 - 2017
UPX 3.94w       Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser   May 12th 2017

        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
    --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
    883745 <-    335288   37.94%   linux/amd64   flag.unpacked

Unpacked 1 file.

D:\Tools\upx394w>
```

Then we open the output file `flag.unpacked` in IDA. Now the binary can be analyzed normally.  

In function `main`, we can see there is a global variable named `flag`:  

![function_main](./function_main.png "Function 'main' in IDA")

Follow the variable and you will see the flag is:

![flag](./flag.png "Flag")
